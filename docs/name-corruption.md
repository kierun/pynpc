# Name corruption

Did we use a formal implementation of
[Grimm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_law)? No.

Did we use some other philological data? Also no.

Did we do some careful research and testing? Again, no.

We sat around with a bit of code and a file watcher and interactively updated
the rules, watching 50 names update. The list is what we came up with after
about 30 minutes interactive play, and updated all the names in the list by at
least one corruption.
